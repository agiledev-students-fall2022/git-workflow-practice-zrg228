###### I want to talk about a cool article from Insider

Here is the [Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/learning/line-cook-coding-boot-camp-online-courses-software-engineer-career-change-pandemic) link.


What I love about this article is that I find it very relateable for someone who lives in NYC and is around my age. On the other hand it is cool to see this contrast that exists between our lives. While I am in a University with an impressive computer science department, the guy in the story never even went to college. Never the less, he ends up getting a job that I would love. Here is one quote from the article that I found intriguing:
>While I feel challenged at my current job, it feels healthy and more enjoyable, stemming from puzzle-solving rather than being yelled at in a kitchen

## Richard Xu's comment
This is a inspirational article about how a cook became a programmer. Cho's experience proves the infinite possibilities in computer science industry: everyone can became a programmer and make 6-figure if they tried their best. This motivates me to study harder and do not look down on other people.
